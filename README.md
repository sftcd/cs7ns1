## For students who aren't familiar with Linux...	

Some students may not have played about much or at all with Linux/Ubuntu.
I covered some introductory material on that topic last year as part of CS2014.
The repo for that course is [here](https://github.com/sftcd/cs2014) 
and includes a brief introduction to Ubuntu and the shell that 
you can see [here](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/shell/README.html).
